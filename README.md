# Marching-Cubes-Terrain
This is my implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm using Unity.

Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzmw12dbkYY

## Features
  - Unity Job System with the Burst Compiler
  - Realtime terrain editing
  - Smooth the terrain by holding the left ctrl key and left click
  - Two world types:
    - Procedurally-generated infinite world
    - Import from black-and-white heightmap texture

## System Requirements
  - Unity3D (I'm developing this project with version **2019.3.0f6**, but any newer version should also work)

## Setup
  1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Eldemarkki/Marching-Cubes-Terrain.git`
  2. Open the project with Unity
